# Emotion & Sentiment Analysis

It is an emotion identification project that tries to identify emotions from text namely : anger, disgust,
fear, sadness, joy, surprise. 


Currently fine grained evaluations are being done i.e. each of the emotion classes are further subdivided
into high or low, eg. high anger / low anger.

Initially each of the sentence is annotated with a continious value [0,100] for each emotion.

A sentence can be therefore 30% anger, 20% disgust,10% fear and so on. 

Fined grained classification treats [0,50) as low and [50,100] as high.

Will be enhanced for coarse grained evaluation where it may be possible to tell the quantity of emotion.

For each emotion, false positives are currently high (will be improved).
